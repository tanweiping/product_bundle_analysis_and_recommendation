![alt text](crisp_dm.png)
## Introduction
Product Bundle Analysis & Recommendation (PBAR) will be following the CRISP-DM (Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) methodology, which provides a structured approach to planning a data mining project. CRISP-DM outlines a 6-phase iterative framework which are namely – Business Understanding, Data Understanding/Exploration, Data Preparation, Modelling, Evaluation, and Deployment. 

## Purpose of Project
PBAR will involve the incorporation of data from existing company transaction in order to create a personalised recommendation system that can aid in the Relationship Manager’s decision making for the additional products that should be cross-sell to the customers. 

PBAR consists of both Business and Data Mining objective.

### Business Understanding Objectives
On a business perspective, PBAR will be following one of the key marketing strategies known as “what customers like you also bought” in order to give the customers a sense of belonging to the bank. 

### Data Mining Objectives
On a data mining perspective, this marketing strategy will be supported using the Market Basket Analysis to determine what products customers with a similar profile have purchased, before making this recommendation to the relevant customers. 
## What to expect in this project?
To create this recommendation system, there are 3 key milestones that are completed:

**1) Data Exploration & Preparation**
* **Purpose:** Data cleaning and wrangling on the transactions. 
    * Since the data comes from several product type tagged under multiple income streams, data integration and transformation will be necessary to ensure that the product types are clearly processed with the use of powerful libraries like Pandas and visualisation libraries like Seaborn. 
*  **Files:** Product_Bundle_Analysis_and_Recommendation_M1.ipynb

**2) Data Modelling**
* **Purpose:** In the second milestone, it will focus on enhancing on the Market Basket Analysis algorithm (Apriori) using R to make it more personalised and suitable for the business problem. Market Basket Analysis is an extremely useful technique used to uncover associations between items. 
    * Through this model, the student analyst should be able to mine for the product bundles that are meaningful and relevant for each profile/subsector. 
    * On top of using R for data mining, Excel will be used to provide personalised recommendation for each customer instead of only providing recommendation on the profile-level in R. In Excel, there are multiple data manipulations involved. 

**3) Data Visualisation**
* **Purpose:** The main usage of this dashboard tool will be to facilitate the RMs on the product recommendation based on the client’s profile and existing products.
